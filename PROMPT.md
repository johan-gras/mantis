Ultrathink - Build a production-quality Rust CLI backtest engine for quantitative trading tailored towards modern deep learning workflows.

Beyond the core, improve the engine however you see fit:
- Add useful features
- Improve documentation
- Add more test cases
- Optimize performance
- Add example strategies
- Whatever else you think a production system needs

Run `cargo test` after making changes. Fix failures before moving on.
